# project overview

As a software developer, I was tasked with designing a static website for New Tech, a company that buys and sells quality electronic items. The purpose of this project was to demonstrate my knowledge of HTML and CSS. (according to the project)

New Tech had been using a customer care service to order items over the phone but at their Annual General Meeting held on 20th January 2022, they decided to expand their selling rates and develop a fully functional e-commerce web application. They called for tenders from software development companies and my company was selected for the project.

The website was designed using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. I had to make the design from scratch, without using templates, and I was free to add extra pages if needed. The focus was on the frontend design and I did not have to program for the backend process.

The website had to include a customer login and registration page, a home page, product listing and single product view, a cart and watchlist, purchased history and invoicing, product adding and updating, advanced search, admin sign in, and an admin panel to manage products and users. I made use of input fields, dropdowns, buttons, checkboxes, radio buttons, navbars and sliders to enhance the functionality of the website.

One of the challenges I faced during the development of this project was with CSS animations. I had to spend a lot of time researching and finding answers on Stack Overflow. However, I was able to overcome these obstacles and deliver a fully functional website that met the requirements of New Tech.

This project not only helped me to improve my HTML and CSS skills but also provided me with a practical application of the technologies that I had learned. I am proud of my achievement and look forward to taking on similar projects in the future.

special thank to Manula Hansaka mudunkotuwa for editing images for the project.
