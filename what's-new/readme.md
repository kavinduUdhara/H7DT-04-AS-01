**User:**
I'm a students that willing to sit for tha Advanced Level examination in sri lanka. and I'm doing economics as a suject for that. so in that economics is the most hardest suject for me, couse it's more theoritical and there are a lot to memorize... that's why I decided to take some different study technique for that like (Analogies and Metaphors)

a one thing to note is that I'm not willing to write the exam in english. But I can understnad english. So in any of this conversation, the target is not to memorize technical terms. It's all about understand the concept.

I'm learning a complementary(7) called 'Investigates the way of contribution of the banking system to the economic activities by identifying the behaviour of money and general price level.' and under that complementary, there are 7 complementary levels, but for now understnad first 3 complementray levels are fine... so following are the complementary levels respectively:

- 7.1 - Inquires money, types of money and functions of money.
- 7.2 - Inquires the reasons for money demand and the factors affecting the money demand.
- 7.3 - Presents money supply analytically

---

**ChatGPT:**
Sure, I can help you understand the concepts of the complementary levels you mentioned in economics. Since you prefer not to focus on memorizing technical terms and instead want to grasp the underlying concepts, I'll explain them using simple analogies and metaphors.
Complementary Level 7.1 - Inquires about money, types of money, and functions of money:
Think of money as the lifeblood of an economy, just like blood is essential for the human body to function. Money serves as a medium of exchange, just like your heart pumps blood to different parts of your body. It facilitates transactions, allowing goods and services to flow between people and businesses.
Now, there are different types of money. One type is physical currency, such as coins and banknotes. These can be compared to red blood cells carrying oxygen throughout your body. Another type is electronic money, like digital transactions and online payments, which can be compared to the electrical impulses that transmit messages within your body.
Money also performs various functions within the economy. One of its key functions is acting as a store of value, similar to how your body stores energy in the form of fat reserves. Money can be saved or invested for future use. It also serves as a unit of account, like the measuring units used in science. Money allows us to compare the value of different goods and services, just as measuring units help us quantify various aspects of the physical world.
Complementary Level 7.2 - Inquires about the reasons for money demand and factors affecting money demand:
The demand for money can be compared to your need for water. Just as you need water to survive and function properly, individuals and businesses require money to carry out their economic activities.
Several reasons contribute to the demand for money. One reason is the transaction motive, which is similar to your need for water to satisfy your thirst. People need money to make everyday purchases and engage in economic transactions. Another reason is the precautionary motive, which is like having a water bottle handy in case you get thirsty later. People hold money as a precautionary measure to meet unexpected expenses or emergencies.
Factors that affect money demand can be compared to the factors that affect your thirst. For example, the level of income and wealth influences the amount of money people need for their daily expenses, just as physical activity and weather conditions affect your body's water requirements. Interest rates also impact money demand. When interest rates are high, people may choose to hold less money and invest it elsewhere, just as drinking other beverages when you have plenty of water available.
Complementary Level 7.3 - Presents money supply analytically:
To understand money supply analytically, let's imagine a garden with different types of plants representing the various components of the money supply. Just as a garden has different plants contributing to its overall beauty, the money supply consists of various sources that contribute to the total amount of money in circulation.
One significant component of money supply is the currency issued by the central bank, which can be compared to a majestic tree providing shade and shelter to the garden. This physical currency is in the form of banknotes and coins.
Another component is the demand deposit accounts held in commercial banks. Think of these accounts as beautiful flowers blossoming in the garden. People deposit money into these accounts, and it can be accessed through checks, debit cards, or online transactions.
The central bank also plays a vital role in controlling and influencing the money supply. It acts as the gardener of the garden, ensuring that the plants grow in harmony. The central bank can adjust the money supply through various measures, such as open market operations, reserve requirements, and interest rate policies. These actions are like the gardener trimming, watering, or fertilizing the plants to maintain balance and growth in the garden.
By understanding these analogies and metaphors, you can gain a conceptual understanding of the topics covered in complementary levels 7.1, 7.2, and 7.3. Remember to relate the concepts to real-life situations and visualize the analogies to enhance your understanding.

Certainly! Let's explore the functions of money by comparing them to the functions of organs in the human body:
<li><p>Medium of Exchange: Money can be compared to the circulatory system in the human body. Just as blood flows through the circulatory system, carrying oxygen and nutrients to different organs, money acts as a medium of exchange, facilitating the flow of goods and services in the economy.</p></li><li><p>Store of Value: Similar to how the liver in the human body stores and releases essential nutrients, money serves as a store of value, allowing individuals to accumulate and preserve their wealth over time.</p></li><li><p>Unit of Account: Just as the brain in the human body processes information and helps us understand the world, money acts as a unit of account, providing a standardized measure that allows us to compare and evaluate the value of different goods and services.</p></li><li><p>Standard of Deferred Payment: Money can be compared to the skeletal system in the human body. Just as the skeleton provides a framework for the body and supports movement, money acts as a standard of deferred payment, providing a framework for financial transactions and facilitating economic activities.</p></li>
By visualizing the functions of money as the functions of organs in the human body, you can create a relatable image that represents the vital role money plays in facilitating transactions, preserving wealth, measuring value, and providing a foundation for economic activities.
